**Implementation Plan: drive.io + Moltbot (OpenClaw) Integration**

## **1. Project Overview**

**Objective:** Enable autonomous agents (Moltbot/OpenClaw) to programmatically interact with drive.io to store text clips and upload files via a standardized Skill.

**Target IDE:** Antigravity (Agentic Mode)

## ---

**2. Phase 1: API Layer (The "Hands")**

Since drive.io is a Vercel/Next.js app, we need a secure, stateless API route that agents can hit.

### **Task 1: Create API Token System**

* **Location:** /api/user/keys
* **Requirement:** Allow users to generate a "Moltbot API Key."
* **Logic:** Store a hashed version of the key in your DB associated with the userId.

### **Task 2: Build the POST /api/v1/clips Route**

* **Input:** JSON payload containing { content: string, title?: string, isPrivate: boolean }.
* **Logic:** \* Verify Authorization: Bearer <API\_KEY>.

  * Save content to the "Cloud Clipboard" database.

* **Output:** Returns a short URL: drive.io/c/unique-id.

## ---

**3. Phase 2: The OpenClaw Skill (The "Brain")**

Agents don't just "hit APIs"; they need a SKILL.md file that explains **how** and **why** to use the tool.

### **Task 3: Create skills/drive-io/SKILL.md**

Create a file in your repo with the following spec for Antigravity to reference:

Markdown

\# Skill: drive.io Cloud Bridge  
Manage your cloud clipboard and file transfers.

\## Tools  
### create\*\_clip\*  
*- **\*\*Description:\*\*** Sends text, code snippets, or logs to the user's cloud clipboard.*  
*- **\*\*Parameters:\*\****  
*- `content`: (string) The text to save.*  
*- `label`: (string) Optional name for the clip.*  
*- **\*\*Returns:\*\*** A drive.io URL.*

*### upload\_file\_stream*  
*- **\*\*Description:\*\*** Uploads a file generated by the agent to the cloud.*  
*- **\*\*Parameters:\*\*** - `filePath`: (string) Local path to the file.*

## ---

**4. Phase 3: Authentication \& Security**

* **CORS Policy:** Ensure the API routes allow requests from openclaw.io and local agent environments.
* **Rate Limiting:** Implement a basic Vercel KV or Upstash rate limiter (e.g., 10 uploads/minute) to prevent agent loops from burning your S3/Vercel credits.

## ---

**5. Phase 4: Discovery \& Deployment**

* **Route:** /public/moltbot.json

  * Create a "Discovery" endpoint that tells agents what your service is capable of.

* **ClawHub Registry:** Prepare the metadata for submission to ClawHub.ai.

**6. Antigravity Prompting Guide**

To have **Antigravity** execute this, use the following prompt:

"Using the provided implementation.md, please build the API infrastructure for the Moltbot integration. Start by creating the POST /api/v1/clips endpoint in Next.js. Use our existing database schema for clips. Then, generate the SKILL.md file in a new /skills directory so I can test this locally with my OpenClaw instance."

**Hypothetical Curl Request and Response (please feel free to adjust as-needed for the most optimal solution)**



**curl -X POST https://drive.io/api/v1/upload \\**

  **-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR\_MOLTBOT\_API\_KEY" \\**

  **-F "file=@/Users/deji/documents/reports/analysis\_v1.pdf" \\**

  **-F "title=Weekly Analysis Report" \\**

  **-F "isPublic=false"**
